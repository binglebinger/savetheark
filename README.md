# SaveTheArk.com – Community Protest Initiative

This is the **official GitHub Pages source** for [https://savetheark.com](https://savetheark.com), a community-led protest against the monetization practices and management of the ARK franchise under Snail Games.

Our mission is to **protect the integrity of ARK**, **support modders and players**, and **demand accountability** from its parent publisher. We believe that the players have power when united — and this site is one way we’re organizing that voice.

## What This Site Is
